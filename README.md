# cBasics

This project was created to explore the basics of C and apply them to a real-world example (Raspberry PI GIPO control).
The repo itself is only a small portion of what went into this - the main task was to research the underlying principles of programming that I wanted to understand better.

These are:

- Compilers
- Memory Allocation
- Garbage Collection

Additionally, this helped me understand the "quality of life" improvements that modern programming languages include.
